After we do the test, It's easy conclude that by an instance of Design 6 you can create design 2 or 3 for proficiency Or either design 2 or 3 for time efficiency.
depend on the purpose of users we can determine which design we should go for. since with design 6 we dont need to create conversion between Polar and Cartesian.
the Disadvatages of Design 6 is an interface so you have to implements and modify other class to fit and keep the system run as usual.
